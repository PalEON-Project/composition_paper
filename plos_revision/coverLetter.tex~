\opening{Dear Editor,}

This submission presents a new statistically-derived data product and
the methods used to create the product. The product provides a gridded
estimate of forest composition, with uncertainty, for much of the
northeastern United States at the time of European colonization and
subsequent settlement by the expanding United States. As such, it is
valuable resource for ecologists and for climate change work as it
provides baseline information about forests before widespread European
land use change.

This work builds on previous efforts to collate settlement-era data on
tree composition provided by surveying efforts. We have synthesized a
much broader array of data than previously publicly available and now
provide a statistical product based on this synthesis.

With regard to possible editors, either someone with expertise in statistics applied to environmental applications or someone with expertise in biogeography or landscape-scale ecology would be appropriate. In particular we suggest Franco Biondi or Ben Bond-Lambery.

Thank you for your consideration of our manuscript.






\closing{Sincerely,}
