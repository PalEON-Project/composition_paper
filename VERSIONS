paper.lyx was final version converted to arXiv format in arxiv directory

paper.lyx outputted to paper.tex 

paper-plos.tex is result of applying plos template to paper.tex


much monkeying to get fig2 to include all images
eps in arxiv are from conversions (see arxiv/labbook)

fig2: use fig2-eps-converted-to.pdf because it's smaller and when save as eps it blows up
in ppt insert->photo->from file 
shrink legend files (pdf input) to 20% (format->picture->size)
save as pdf; open in acrobat and save as eps
result is fig2.eps

in submission use arxiv/fig{1,3}.eps
