==== Jan 2016 ====

paper.lyx is now version revised for PLOS ONE

outputted to paper.tex and then revised to give paper-plos.tex as result of applying plos template

have version w/ and w/o changes marked in red (paper-plos-track.tex)

compile to get the bbl info and paste into paperPlos.tex

# pdftops -eps fig1.pdf # doesnt work well
pdf2ps fig1.pdf; ps2eps fig1.ps  # smaller

# combine fig2.pdf and legend{Raw,Prop,SD}.pdf in ppt (letter portrait, 95% of fig2.pdf, 20% of legends); save as fig2comb.pdf
# pdftops -eps fig2comb.pdf  # doesn't work well
pdf2ps fig2comb.pdf; ps2eps fig2comb.ps  # state lines better

pdf2ps fig3.pdf; ps2eps fig3.ps 

# direct creation of eps in R works well but creates much bigger files that are too big for PLOS ONE

create pdf with red track changes and mv to paperPlos_track.pdf and paperPlos_track.tex

==== fall 2015 =====
paper.lyx was final version converted to arXiv format in arxiv directory

paper.lyx outputted to paper.tex 

paperPlos.tex is result of applying plos template to paper.tex


much monkeying to get fig2 to include all images
eps in arxiv are from conversions (see arxiv/labbook)

fig2: use fig2-eps-converted-to.pdf because it's smaller and when save as eps it blows up
in ppt insert->photo->from file 
shrink legend files (pdf input) to 20% (format->picture->size)
save as pdf; open in acrobat and save as eps
result is fig2.eps

in submission use arxiv/fig{1,3}.eps
